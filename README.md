# Maple

## What's this project?

Maple is a music library and organization tool. It allows you to upload your music library, then watch it be organized into albums, artists, playlists, etc! You are given robust controls to play and organize your music. In the future, it'll include optional social and stat tracking features.

## What's the inspiration behind it?

I was inspired to make this through many times in my life, such as being on a plane with no internet. Where I had my music, but found my local tools to play it lacking. For example, windows media player, etc. So this project is not only to solve that issue forever. But to help me learn.
