    <p>Maple is a music library and organization tool. It allows you to upload your music library and watch it be organized into albums, artists, playlists, and more! You are given robust controls to play and organize your music. In the future, it will include optional social and stat-tracking features.</p>

## What's the inspiration behind it?

<div style="text-align: left;">
    <p style="font-size: 1rem; font-weight: medium; margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">I was inspired to create this project from various experiences in my life, such as being on a plane without internet. While I had my music with me, I found local tools like Windows Media Player lacking. This project not only aims to solve that issue but also serves as a learning experience for me.</p>
